# Atom Black Syntax #
A truly black high-contrast syntax theme for Atom. Seriously. It's black. It is based on Atom Dark but with a truly black background. Works with [Atom Black UI](http://atom.io/packages/atom-black-ui/).

## Planned Changes
1. Reduce the number of bold items. E.g., make string weight normal.
2. Change string color. E.g., Probably change strings to white.
3. Use the existing semantic .less variables. 
4. Clean up .less sheets with better, clearer comments and remove duplicate lines and overwritten styles

## Note ###
This is still a work-in-progress.

### Terminal Themes
I've also built out some Atom Black-compatible terminal and terminal emulator styles for Mac and PC.
The mac terminal style is basically Smyck.
The PC terminal emulator styles for Bash and Shell are similar to Smyck but built separately.
High-level Instructions for installing these are here: https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles
Direct links to these profiles are below.
I'll provide better, beginning-to-end instructions in the future.

#### PC Terminal Emulator Styles
If you are on a PC and have ConEmu, you can download
1. Atom Black-compatible shell terminal emulator style here https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles/blob/master/.bashrc
2. Atom Black-compatible bash terminal emulator style here https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles/blob/master/.profile

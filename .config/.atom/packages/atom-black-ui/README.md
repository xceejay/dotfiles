### Terminal Themes
I've also built out some Atom Black-compatible terminal and terminal emulator styles for Mac and PC.
The mac terminal style is basically Smyck.
The PC terminal emulator styles for Bash and Shell are similar to Smyck but built separately.
High-level Instructions for installing these are here: https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles
Direct links to these profiles are below.
I'll provide better, beginning-to-end instructions in the future.

#### PC Terminal Emulator Styles
If you are on a PC and have ConEmu, you can download
1. Atom Black-compatible shell terminal emulator style here https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles/blob/master/.bashrc
2. Atom Black-compatible bash terminal emulator style here https://github.com/academicjargon/bash-profiles/blob/master/.profile

#### Mac Terminal Styles ###
If you are on a Mac, you can also download an Atom Black-compatible terminal style http://atom.io/packages/atom-black-syntax/Smyck.terminal
